42 Unit Factory Project

This project implements simulation tools for the financial markets that exchange a simplified
version of FIX messages. The tools are be able to communicate over a network using the TCP protocol.

## Router

The router is the central component of applications. All other components connect
to it in order to send messages to other components. The router perform no buiness
logic, it just dispatches messages to the destination component(s). The router must
accept incomming connections from multiple brokers and markets. We call the router a
market connetivity provider, because it allows brokers to send messages (in FIX format)
to markets, without depending on specific implementation of the market.

**The router will listen on 2 ports:**

- Port 5000 for messages from Broker components. When a Broker establishes the
connection the Router asigns it a unique 6 digit ID and communicates the ID to
the Broker.

- Port 5001 for messages from Market components. When a Market establishes the
connection the Router asigns it a unique 6 digit ID and communicates the ID to
the Market.

Brokers and Markets will include the assigned ID in all messages for identification
and the Router will use the ID to create the routing table.

**Once the Router receives a message it will perform 3 steps:**
- Validate the message based on the checkshum.
- Identify the destination in the routing table.
- Forward the message.

## Broker

**The Broker will send two types of messages:**
- Buy. - An order where the broker wants to buy an instrument
- Sell. - An order where the broker want to sell an instrument

**and will receive from the market messages of the following types:**
- Exeuted - when the order was accepted by the market and the action succeeded
- Rejected - when the order could not be met

## Market

A market has a list of instruments that can be traded. When orders are received from
brokers the market tries to execute it. If the execution is successfull, it updates the
internal instrument list and sends the broker an Executed message. If the order canâ€™t be
met, the market sends a Rejected message.

## FIX Messages

All messages start with the ID asigned by the router and are ended by the
checksum.

**Buy and Sell messages have the following fields:**
- Message Type
- Message Action
- Instrument
- Quantity
- Market
- Price

## Bonus

All transactions are stored in a database.
